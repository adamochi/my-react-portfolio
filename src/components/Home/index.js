              This year has been a turning point in my life as I have completely
              dedicated my time into becoming a Web Developer. Since starting my
              journey into learning how to code, I found myself enjoying it more
              and more each day.
            </p>
            <p>
              With 800+ hours of studying &amp; practicing writing code over the
              course of this year, I have gained a solid understanding of HTML,
              CSS, basic JavaScript. As well as the React JS framework which I
              have built this website on!

              <strong>How did I make it this far by Self study?</strong>
              <br /> For the majority of the time I have been studying, I have
              undertaken online courses at Nomad Coders.

              <strong>Things I like:</strong>
              <br />
              My everyday hobbies are listening to music, coding, &amp; cooking.
              <br />
              <strong>What I get up to:</strong>
              <br />I am a sound engineer at church. I have had a passion for
              good audio for many years. And even considered a career path in
              the audio world.
              <br />
              <strong>Life before coding;</strong>
              <br />
              In 2009 I Completed my Chef apprenticeship in Cairns, and
              continued cooking in dynamic and fast paced environments for many
              years to come undertaken 3 courses and 2 bootcamps. A leap into
              something I have truly become more passionate about remaining
              essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
              release of Letraset sheets If there is one thing i have learnt
              form working in the kitchen, it's communication and organisatinoal
              skills. skills from kitchen i can use
