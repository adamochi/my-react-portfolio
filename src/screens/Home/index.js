                As far back as I can remember, I have been fascinated with
                computers. I have always had a strong interest to learn and to
                make things work. Since starting my journey into learning how to
                code, I&apos;ve found myself enjoying it more and more each day
                as I solve new challenges and build upon my skills.

                From studying &amp; practicing writing code over the course of
                this year, I have gained a solid understanding of JavaScript ES6
                and React which I have built multiple applications with. Now I
                am looking to start my new career as a front end web developer

              <h6>More about me:</h6>
              <p>
                Although I wasn&apos;t able to follow this path when I graduated
                high school, I had this goal to change my career when I got
                older. This year has been that turning point in my life as I
                have completely dedicated my time into becoming a Web Developer.
              </p>
              <h6>Life before coding:</h6>
              <p>
                In 2009 I Completed my Chef apprenticeship in Cairns, and
                continued cooking in dynamic and fast paced environments for
                many years to come.
                <br />
                Besides improving my cooking skills, I grew to be good under
                pressure and developed my teamwork skills. Being good in a team
                and communicating well also meant becoming a good listener and
                someone that could take in the feedback from others and use it
                to improve any aspect of my work.
